# pnpm Migration Complete âœ…

This project now uses **pnpm** as the package manager instead of npm.

## What Changed

### âœ… Dependencies Installed
- **Service A**: All dependencies installed with pnpm
- **Service B**: All dependencies installed with pnpm

### âœ… Documentation Updated
All documentation files have been updated to use `pnpm` instead of `npm`:

1. **README.md**
   - Prerequisites section now mentions pnpm 8+
   - Local development commands use `pnpm install` and `pnpm run start:dev`
   - Testing commands use `pnpm test`

2. **GETTING_STARTED.md**
   - Prerequisites updated to include pnpm
   - All npm commands replaced with pnpm

3. **CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Development setup includes pnpm installation step
   - All commands updated to use pnpm

4. **TESTING.md**
   - Unit test commands updated to use pnpm

5. **setup.sh**
   - Script now checks for pnpm installation
   - Auto-installs pnpm if not present
   - Uses pnpm for dependency installation

6. **Makefile**
   - `make install` uses pnpm
   - `make test` uses pnpm
   - `make dev-a` and `make dev-b` use pnpm
   - `make format` uses pnpm

## Why pnpm?

pnpm offers several advantages:
- **Faster**: More efficient dependency installation
- **Disk Space**: Uses hard links to save disk space
- **Strict**: Better dependency resolution
- **Monorepo Support**: Better for multi-package projects

## Installation Status

```
âœ… Service A dependencies installed (740 packages)
âœ… Service B dependencies installed (770 packages)
âœ… All documentation updated
âœ… Scripts updated
```

## Quick Commands

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using Makefile
make install

# Using setup script
./setup.sh

# Manual installation
cd service-a && pnpm install
cd ../service-b && pnpm install
```

### Run Services Locally
```bash
# Service A
cd service-a
pnpm run start:dev

# Service B
cd service-b
pnpm run start:dev
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Service A
cd service-a
pnpm test

# Service B
cd service-b
pnpm test
```

### Other Commands
```bash
# Build
pnpm run build

# Lint
pnpm run lint

# Start production
pnpm run start:prod
```

## Docker Containers

Note: Docker containers still use npm internally (as defined in Dockerfiles). This is intentional because:
- Docker images are isolated
- pnpm is primarily beneficial for local development
- npm in containers keeps images simpler

If you want to use pnpm in Docker as well, you would need to:
1. Install pnpm in Dockerfiles
2. Update package installation commands in Dockerfiles

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check pnpm version
pnpm --version

# Check installed packages
cd service-a && pnpm list
cd service-b && pnpm list

# Run quick test
./quick-test.sh
```

## Notes

- All `node_modules` directories are managed by pnpm
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` files will be generated (similar to package-lock.json)
- Existing `package.json` files remain unchanged
- All scripts in package.json work the same way

## Migration Date

**Completed**: October 1, 2025
